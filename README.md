# NikevsAdidas
In this project, I tried to help answer the age-old question, Nike or Adidas. I found a dataset on Kaggle listing all Nike and Adidas products and wanted to compare the two companies and see what some similarities and differences between their products were. I used Microsoft SQL Server to help answer several questions and used these queries with Excel and Tableau to create and buyers guide showing a snapshot of frequently asked consumer questions along with the results. You can see the tableau dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashtin4783/viz/Nikevs_AdidasBuyersGuide/NikevsAdidasDB
